> Code Ninjas presents... Hack-o-lantern Hack-a-thon
> ~Coding for Good!

## Introduction

Calling all Code Ninjas! Get ready for an electrifying coding adventure at our "**Hack-o-lantern Hack-a-thon**", where young tech enthusiasts can embark on a thrilling journey of creativity and innovation. But this year, it's not just about coding for the sake of it - we're coding for a great cause! In collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity, this Hack-a-thon will not only challenge your coding skills but also help make a positive impact on the lives of young children.

### Coding for Good!

In the world of Code Ninjas, it's not just about mastering coding languages and building fantastic games; it's also about using those skills to make a difference. That's why, this year, we're proud to partner with Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity. Your child's participation in this event will not only enhance their coding skills but will also contribute to a great cause - supporting the critical work of children's hospitals and helping young lives.

## Event Details

Here are the essential details for the "**Hack-o-lantern Hack-a-thon**":
