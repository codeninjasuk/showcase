## What is Become a Youtuber?
Ninjas will work together to create and customize a shared YouTube channel, including the design of unique channel art, profile pictures, and video thumbnails. They will also be guided through how to record, edit, and upload videos. Throughout camp, Ninjas will analyze popular YouTube videos and learn about copyrights and fair use to give them what it takes to become a YouTuber!

Here at Code Ninjas Langley, as part of our "Become a Youtuber" Camp, our kids have created amazing content that we'd like to share.
