## What is Stopmotion Animation?
Stop motion is an animated filmmaking technique in which objects are physically manipulated in small increments between individually photographed frames so that they will appear to exhibit independent motion or change when the series of frames is played back.

Here at Code Ninjas Langley, as part of our "Stopmotion Animation" Camp, our kids have created amazing content that we'd like to share.
