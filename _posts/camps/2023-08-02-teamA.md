## What is Moviemaking with Minecraft?
Ninjas will shift their imagination into high gear as they learn scene building, storytelling, and video recording featuring their own MinecraftÂ® world. They will also jump into the basics of editing and mixing audio as they produce their final stories as short movies.

Here at Code Ninjas Langley, as part of our "Moviemaking with Minecraft" Camp, our kids have created amazing content that we'd like to share.
